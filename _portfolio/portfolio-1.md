The objective of this work is to develop an Autonomous Flapping Wing MAV capable of carrying a payload to a designated location. The project involves three key tasks: takeoff, cruising, and landing. Achieving a trim condition is essential for the cruise phase, and a smooth takeoff is required to reach the necessary altitude.

We are designing a convertible flight system, where the MAV will use flapping for initial lift-off. Once it reaches a certain altitude, the flapping mechanism will shut off, and a propeller will take over for thrust. The tail is employed to balance the pitching moment throughout the flight.
