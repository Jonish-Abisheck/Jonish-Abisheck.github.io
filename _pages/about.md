# **A bit about Me**
![Robot](/images/Robot.jpg){: .align-right width="300px" height="500px"}

📚 I’m a final-year Mechanical Engineering student with a minor in Robotics and Automation.

My research interests lie in robotics, and I am currently exploring different areas to identify my specific field of focus.


# **Research and Experience**
 
I have worked on a 3R serial robotics model for a college project. During my research internship at the Indira Gandhi Nuclear Reactor, I focused on validating the PINET code, a Python-based model for predicting output properties during heat transfer.

Currently, for my final year thesis, I am developing a mathematical model to enable autonomous flight for a flapping-wing MAV.
